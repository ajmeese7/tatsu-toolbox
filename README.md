# tatsu-toolbox
A revamp of the broken Python [Tatsu toolbox](https://github.com/Mattlau04/Tatsumaki-toolbox-discord) repo, 
comissioned by [azatej](https://github.com/zsamuel43).

## Downloading

In a command prompt in your projects folder (wherever that may be), run the following:

`git clone https://github.com/ajmeese7/tatsu-toolbox`

Once finished:

- Ensure you have NodeJS installed on your PC by running `npm`. If not, Google how to install it and do that now
- In the folder from where you ran the git command, run `cd tatsu-toolbox` and then run `npm install`
- Edit `config.json` and enter your token and desired prefix. It should look like this afterwards:

```json
{
  "botToken": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
  "prefix": "YOUR_DESIRED_PREFIX_HERE"
}
```

Your prefix can be anything you want, but I tend to use the `/` because you're unlikely to ever use it on accident.

## Getting your login token

Go to [this link](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Troubleshooting#my-token-is-disappearing-too-quickly-i-cant-copy-it) and follow the instructions
to get your login token.

> **KEEP YOUR TOKEN SECRET, AND NEVER SHARE IT WITH ANYONE**

## Controlling the selfbot
To start the selfbot, open a command prompt from the folder containing the repository, run:

`node index`

To stop it, click on the terminal and press **CTRL+C**, which will kill the process.

## Development
I would like to add in the Tatsugotchi trainer and pet getter features, but I am
not sure how they work.

If someone can explain the process of these to me I will be happy to try to 
replicate the functionality.
